## What You Need to Install (Before Anything Else)

You need **two things** installed on your computer:

### 1. WampServer (gives you Apache + PHP + MySQL)

**What is it?** WAMP bundles three tools together so you don't have to install them separately:
- **Apache** = a web server that serves your HTML/CSS/JS files (like a local version of the internet)
- **PHP** = the language our backend code is written in (handles login, chat, forum logic)
- **MySQL** = a database that stores users, messages, posts, etc.

📥 **Download:** https://www.wampserver.com/en/
- Run the installer, click **Next** on everything (default settings are fine)
- When it's done, launch WampServer from the Start Menu
- Look at the **bottom-right tray** (near the clock) — you'll see a small icon
- Wait until the icon turns **GREEN** ✅ (green = everything is running)
- If it's **orange** 🟠 or **red** 🔴, something went wrong — see [Troubleshooting](#common-problems--how-to-fix-them)

**Quick test:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/` — if you see the WAMP welcome page, you're good!

### 2. Node.js (needed for real-time chat)

**What is it?** Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the server (not just in the browser). We use it for the WebSocket server that makes chat messages appear instantly without refreshing the page.

📥 **Download:** https://nodejs.org/ (pick the **LTS** version — it's the stable one)
- Run the installer, click **Next** on everything
- It also installs **npm** (a tool to install JavaScript packages) automatically

**Quick test:** Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and type:
```
node --version
```
If you see a version number like `v20.11.0`, you're good!

## Step 1: Put the Project in the Right Place

WAMP only serves files from its `www` folder. Your project needs to be accessible there.

### Option A: Create a Shortcut (Recommended — keeps your files where they are)

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** (right-click PowerShell → "Run as administrator")
2. Run this command (change the second path to wherever YOUR project folder is):

```powershell
cmd /c mklink /J "C:\wamp64\www\campus360-redo" "D:\Coding files\Extras\campus360-redo"
```

This creates a "shortcut" (called a symlink) so WAMP can find your files.

### Option B: Just Copy the Folder

Copy your entire `campus360-redo` folder into `C:\wamp64\www\` so it looks like:
```
C:\wamp64\www\campus360-redo\
```

### Check if It Worked

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost/campus360-redo/`

You should see the login page. If you see a "404 Not Found" error, the folder isn't in the right place.

---

## Step 2: Create the Database

The app stores all its data (users, messages, posts) in a MySQL database. You need to create it.

### How to Do It:

1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`
2. **Username:** `root`
3. **Password:** *(leave it blank — just click "Go")*

Now you need to run **two** SQL files, **in this order**:

### File 1: `database.sql` (creates the main tables)

1. Click the **SQL** tab at the top of phpMyAdmin
2. Open the file `database.sql` from your project folder in a text editor (like Notepad)
3. **Select all** the text (Ctrl+A), **copy it** (Ctrl+C)
4. **Paste it** (Ctrl+V) into the SQL text box in phpMyAdmin
5. Click the **Go** button

This creates the database called `campus360` with tables for users, chat messages, etc.

### File 2: `database_forum.sql` (creates the forum tables)

1. Do the same thing BUT with the file `database_forum.sql`
2. Click the **SQL** tab, paste the contents, click **Go**

> ⚠️ **You MUST run `database.sql` first, then `database_forum.sql` second.** The forum tables depend on the user table created by the first file.

### Check if It Worked

In phpMyAdmin, click on the `campus360` database on the left sidebar. You should see **9 tables**:

| Table | What It Stores |
|-------|---------------|
| `users` | User accounts (name, email, password) |
| `chat_invites` | When someone sends you a chat request |
| `conversations` | Each chat conversation (1-on-1 or group) |
| `conversation_members` | Who is in each conversation |
| `messages` | All chat messages |
| `follows` | Who follows whom on the forum |
| `posts` | Forum posts |
| `post_likes` | Likes on forum posts |
| `post_comments` | Comments on forum posts |

If you see all 9, the database is ready! ✅

## Step 3: Install Chat Dependencies

The real-time chat uses two small JavaScript packages. You need to install them.

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**
2. Navigate to your project folder:
```
cd "D:\Coding files\Extras\campus360-redo"
```
(change the path to wherever your project folder is)

3. Run:
```
npm install
```

This reads the `package.json` file and installs:
- **`ws`** — makes the WebSocket server work (real-time messaging)
- **`mysql2`** — lets the WebSocket server talk to the database

You'll see a `node_modules` folder appear — that's normal, don't delete it!

---

## Step 4: Start Everything

You need **TWO things running at the same time** for the app to fully work:

### Thing 1: WAMP Server

1. Launch WampServer from the Start Menu (if it's not already running)
2. Wait for the tray icon to turn **green** ✅

This gives you:
- Apache on **port 80** (serves your web pages)
- MySQL on **port 3306** (stores your data)

### Thing 2: The WebSocket Server

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**
2. Navigate to your project folder:
```
cd "D:\Coding files\Extras\campus360-redo"
```
3. Run:
```
npm start
```

You should see:
```
[DB] Connected to MySQL
[WS] WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8082
```

**Keep this window open!** If you close it, real-time chat stops working (messages will still save, but they won't appear instantly — you'd have to refresh the page).

### Open the App

Go to: **http://localhost/campus360-redo/**

That's it! You should see the login page. Create an account and start using it! 🎉

## How the App Works (Simple Explanation)

```
  YOU (Browser)
      │
      ├──── HTTP requests ────→  Apache + PHP (WAMP)  ←──→  MySQL Database
      │     (login, send msg,       (port 80)                (port 3306)
      │      create post, etc.)
      │
      └──── WebSocket ────→  Node.js Server
            (instant chat)      (port 8082)
```

**In plain English:**
1. When you log in, sign up, send a message, or create a post → your browser sends a request to **PHP** (through Apache), which saves it to the **MySQL database**
2. When you send a chat message → after saving it, your browser ALSO tells the **WebSocket server** → which instantly sends it to the other person's browser (no refresh needed!)
3. The WebSocket server is just for **speed** — if it's not running, the app still works, but you'd have to refresh to see new messages

## WAMP Settings You Might Need to Change

Most of the time, the defaults work fine. But if you run into issues:

### PHP Extensions (make sure these are ON)

Right-click the WAMP tray icon → **PHP** → **PHP extensions** → make sure these are checked:

| Extension | Why You Need It |
|-----------|----------------|
| `php_pdo_mysql` | Connects PHP to MySQL (required!) |
| `php_mysqli` | Backup way to connect to MySQL |
| `php_mbstring` | Handles special characters properly |
| `php_fileinfo` | Detects file types during upload |
| `php_openssl` | Security stuff for sessions |

### PHP Settings (for file uploads)

Right-click the WAMP tray icon → **PHP** → **PHP Settings**:

| Setting | Change To | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| `upload_max_filesize` | `50M` | Allows uploading files up to 50MB |
| `post_max_size` | `52M` | Must be slightly bigger than upload size |

---

## Common Problems & How to Fix Them

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| **WAMP icon is orange or red** | Something crashed. Right-click the icon → check Apache and MySQL error logs |
| **"Port 80 already in use"** | Another app (like Skype or IIS) is using port 80. Close it, or change Apache's port |
| **Can't open `localhost/campus360-redo/`** | Your project folder isn't in `C:\wamp64\www\`. Re-do Step 1 |
| **"Database connection failed"** | Make sure MySQL is running (WAMP icon is green). Check that `php/config.php` has the right password (default is blank) |
| **Login/signup doesn't work** | You probably didn't create the database yet. Go back to Step 2 |
| **Forum shows no posts / search doesn't work** | You forgot to run `database_forum.sql`. Go back to Step 2, File 2 |
| **Chat messages don't appear instantly** | The WebSocket server isn't running. Go back to Step 4, Thing 2 |
| **File upload fails** | Change `upload_max_filesize` to `50M` in PHP settings (see above) |
| **Changes to code aren't showing up** | Hard refresh your browser with `Ctrl + Shift + R`. If that doesn't work, disable OPcache in WAMP |
| **"Not authenticated" errors pop up** | Your session expired. Clear cookies and log in again |
| **`npm install` fails** | Make sure Node.js is installed. Try running PowerShell as Administrator |
| **`npm start` says "port 8082 in use"** | You already have the WebSocket server running in another terminal. Close it first |

## Quick Reference: Ports Used

| What | Port | When It's Running |
|------|------|------------------|
| Apache (web pages) | 80 | When WAMP is green |
| MySQL (database) | 3306 | When WAMP is green |
| WebSocket (instant chat) | 8082 | When you run `npm start` |

---

## Quick Reference: Database Credentials

These are the default WAMP settings. If you changed your MySQL password, update these files:

| Setting | Value | Where to Change |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Host | `localhost` | `php/config.php` (line 9) and `ws-server.js` (line 15) |
| Database | `campus360` | `php/config.php` (line 10) and `ws-server.js` (line 16) |
| Username | `root` | `php/config.php` (line 11) and `ws-server.js` (line 17) |
| Password | *(blank)* | `php/config.php` (line 12) and `ws-server.js` (line 18) |
